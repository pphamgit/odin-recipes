My first web development project thanks to the Odin Project.
I noticed a web design, or rather, learned the name of a very simplistic web design... it's called "Brutalistic."
I believe I can make this web design work, assuming I apply my OCD nature to this web project.
I want to keep this project simple, clean, readable and serve its purpose.
Perhaps by completing this project it will set the foundation for many future websites to come.
Perhaps this project will have many versions!
